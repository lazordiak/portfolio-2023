          This gif showcases the UI for Weather Journals. When loading the page,
          the sun and moon rise (and set) until they reach the current position
          of the sun in New York City. The clouds move according to wind speed,
          and if it&apos;s raining in New York you&apos;ll also see rain appear
          in the site. After the celestial bodies reach the correct position,
          the prompts will appear and the user can input text.

          <span className="mt-6 lg:mt-12">
            In a time in which we, as humans, have unparalled control over the
            smallest details of our lives, the weather still stands as something
            outside us and separate from us, something that we have to live with
            and react to. I find that very calming, in a way; no matter what
            happens to me, or any of us, the clouds will continue to move across
            the sky.
          </span>
          <span className="mt-6 lg:mt-12">
            At the same time, I wanted to play with the idea of how we could
            interact with the weather. I was thinking of a weather journal, the
            idea of a place to record one&apos;s observations of the weather,
            when the idea came to me of the weather writing to you. That was the
            impetus for this project.

          <span className="mt-6 lg:mt-12">
            The project has two parts to it: the background sketch and the text
            generation. The sketch that runs in the background uses weather data
            drawn from the OpenWeather API for the NYC metropolitan area. The
            position of the sun and moon correspond to the current time in New
            York City, while the movement of clouds corresponds to the current
            wind speed and the amount of rain present in the sketch is
            determined by rainfall in New York.
          </span>
          <span className="mt-6 lg:mt-12">
            The text generation portion of the project is powered by a
            fine-tuned version of OpenAI&apos;s smallest GPT2 model, the 117M
            model. Using Docker, the application is bundled and hosted on
            Google&apos;s Cloud Run; when the user submits a reflection in the
            Weather Journals page, text is generated by the application in the
            cloud and appears on the user&apos;s screen.
          </span>
          <span className="mt-6 lg:mt-12">
            Through interaction with users, the model&apos;s text generation
            output is constantly evolving. When users input a reflection on the
            weather, their response is stored in a database. At the end of each
            day, the model hosted on Google Cloud Run is trained on the
            collective responses received that day, which means that the next
            round of stories from the weather will be influenced by everyone who
            has participated before.

            This is another project that feeds into my interest in using
            data-driven constraints to derive meaning from human interaction. To
            me it is one of the most interesting things in the world to see how
            people interpret objective data subjectively. The weather cannot
            tell stories, but we can tell stories about the weather. In the
            future, I&apos;d like to add a physical interaction component to the
            project (I had toyed around with the idea of having paper printed
            responses that dropped from a printer on the ceiling) and of course
            update to the latest GPT!
